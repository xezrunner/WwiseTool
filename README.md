# Wwise Tool  
This tool is intended for automating the browsing, playback and exporting of compiled Wwise `.pck`/`.bnk` files, including linkage between Wwise events and referenced audio files.

## ðŸš§ Work in progress
The project is in **early** development. Do not expect _functional_ functionality at this time.

## Supported projects
The following projects using Wwise are confirmed to work with this project:
- Dishonored 2 `.pck` `target`

  <summary>Legend</summary>
  
  - `target`: This project is targeted for tool development: it is being used for implementation and testing.

  - `pck`: Package file containing both the Wwise bank (`.bnk`) and audio files (`.wem`)\
            These need extracting before processing.\
            **_NOTE:_** do not use `.pck` extraction for audio files, as they are inaccurate.

  - `bnk`: A Wwise bank file containing Wwise metadata and `.wem` audio files.
            These also need extracting, for both the event metadata and audio files.

  - `wem`: Wwise audio file\
            These can be played by **vgmstream**, but can also be converted to a more usable format.

  - `txtp`: **vgmstream** TXTP command file
